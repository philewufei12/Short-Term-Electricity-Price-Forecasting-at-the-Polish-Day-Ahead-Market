## Overview <a name = "overview"></a>

This repository contains the experimental source code for short term electricity price forecasting at the Polish SPOT market (Power Exchange Day-Ahead Market)  including RNN, LSTM, GRU, MLP and Prophet models. 


## Modeled time series of electricity prices at the Polish Power Exchange Day-Ahead-Market <a name = "modeled_time_series_of_electricity_prices"></a>

The analysis is based on a series of over 26.200 hourly observations of fixing I prices (PLN/MWh) from January 2018 to December 2020. The figure below shows the time series with electricity prices during this period.

The analysis of the time series of electricity prices confirmed the one described in the literature auto-regressive nature of this process. Shown in the figure below
graph of the autocorrelation function of the modeled time series, on which you can note that the price of electricity at a given hour is significantly affected by the value of the electricity price from the past corresponding to a delay of multiples of **24 hours**.

## Results <a name = "results"></a>
According to the table below, **RNN** outperformed the other models.

| Model | MAE [PLN/MWh] ↓ | RMSE [PLN/MWh] ↓ | MAPE [%]↓ | R Squared [-] ↑ |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Prophet | 16.9 | 21.8 | 7.54 | 0.86 |
| MLP | 16.61 | 21.23 | 7.32 | 0.87 |
| **RNN (Vanilla)** | **16.15** | **20.84** | **6.94** | **0.87** |
| LSTM | 17.15 | 22.5 | 7.26 | 0.85 | 
| GRU | 17 | 22.12 | 7.32 | 0.86 |


In the figures below shows the actual and forecast electricity price at the Polish Power Exchange Day Ahead Market in the sample period from test set. Forecasts have been generated by the model based on the Vanilla RNN, which was characterized by
the highest accuracy of electricity price predictions in the test period.
